                without limitation any claim for personal injury or
                property damage, arising from this agreement and any
                violation by you of any federal, state, or local laws,
                statutes, rules, or regulations, even if the company
                has been previously advised of the possibility of such
                damage. Except as prohibited by law, if there is
                liability found on the part of the company, it will be
                limited to the amount paid for the products and/or
                services, and under no circumstances will there be
                consequential or punitive damages. In a state where
                the exclusion or limitation of punitive, incidental,
                or consequential damages is not allowed, the prior
                limitation or exclusion will not apply to clients of
                such states

              Termination
              <p>
                We may terminate or suspend your account and bar
                access to the website immediately, without prior
                notice or liability, under our sole discretion, for
                any reason whatsoever and without limitation,
                including but not limited to a breach of Terms. If you
                wish to terminate your account, you may simply
                discontinue using the website. All provisions of Terms
                that by their nature should survive termination shall
                survive termination, including, without limitation,
                ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, indemnity,
                and limitations of liability.

              Governing Law
              <p>
                These Terms shall be governed and construed in
                accordance with the laws of London, which governing
                law applies to the agreement without regard to its
                conflict of law provisions. Our failure to enforce any
                right or provision of these Terms will not be
                considered a waiver of those rights. If any provision
                of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable
                by a court, the remaining provisions of these Terms
                will remain in effect. These Terms constitute the
                entire agreement between us regarding our website and
                supersede and replace any prior agreements we might
                have had between us regarding the website.

              Changes to the company website
              <p>
                We reserve the right to amend our website and any
                service or material we provide via the website, at our
                sole discretion without notice. We will not be liable
                if for any reason all or any part of our website is
                unavailable at any time or for any period. From time
                to time, we may restrict access to some parts of our
                website, or the entire website, to users, including
                registered users.

              <p>
                We may amend the Terms at any time by posting the
                amended terms on this site. It is your responsibility
                to review these Terms periodically. Your continued use
                of the Platform following the posting of revised Terms
                means that you accept and agree to the changes. You
                are expected to check this page frequently so you are
                aware of any changes, as they are binding on you. By
                continuing to access or use our website after any
                revisions become effective, you agree to be bound by
                the revised terms. If you do not agree to the new
                terms, you are no longer authorized to use our
                website.
